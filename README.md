# Chess Pygame GUI

This project started life as the portfolio assignment from my Intro to Computer Programming class. The assignment was a chess variant to be played in the terminal window, with no special moves, where the winner is the first one to make it to the other side of the board.

After class was over, I decided to turn it into full-blown chess game that can be played in a game window via mouse clicks. To accomplish this, I utilized the Pygame module, much like I did to make simple a [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/SandKat214/Tic-Tac-Toe) game. This program utilizes concepts from object-oriented programming, such as composition, inheritance, and polymorphism, between objects of user-defined classes to implement all the traditional rules of chess.
